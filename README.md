To make a profit, a local store marks up the prices of its items by a certain percentage. Write a C++  program that reads the original price of the item sold, the percentage of the marked-up price, and the sales tax rate. The program then outputs the original price of the item, the percentage of the mark-up,  the storeâ€™s selling price of the item, the sales tax, and the final price of the item.
